The Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics (B&B) engages in methodological and collaborative research, and directs four educational degree programs: the Clinical Research Training Program (CRTP),  the Master of Biostatistics Program, the PhD Program, and the Master of Management in Clinical Informatics (MMCi).  Instructors in these programs, as well as other faculty members in the department, either teach courses or supervise student research in the areas of biostatistics, computational biology, statistical genetics, epidemiology, health economics, health services research and computational medicine.

The Department currently has over 50 faculty members who are individually affiliated with various research groups, centers, and institutes across the School of Medicine, including the Duke Clinical Research Institute, the Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy, the Duke Cancer Institute, the Durham VA Medical Center, the Center for HIV/Aids Vaccine Immunology, and the Duke Center for Aging. The discipline of biostatistics constitutes a primary focus of the Department, which serves as the academic home for faculty biostatisticians in the Medical Center.

Outside the School of Medicine, statistics and biostatistics are represented at Duke by the Department of Statistical Science, one of the eight natural science departments in the School of Arts and Sciences. Some Department of Statistical Science faculty members have secondary appointments in B&B, and vice-versa. Secondary appointments are also held by several faculty members in the Center for Human Genetics whose primary appointments are in the Department of Medicine.
