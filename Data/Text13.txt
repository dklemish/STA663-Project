A hungry python tastes the air with its tongue to smell if prey is nearby. Special temperature-sensing pits on its face tells the snake if a warm-bloodedanimal is nearby. When its prey is close enough, the python grabs it with its teeth, then quickly wraps its body around the victim and squeezes. The snake doesn't actually crush the prey and break its bones, though. Instead, it squeezes tightly so that the preyanimal can’t breath and it suffocates. Then the python unhinges its jaws so it can open its mouth wide enough to swallow the food whole.
 
Some people think that pythons launch themselves out of trees onto unsuspecting animals below, but that's not a good move. Diving out of a tree like that could cause serious injury to the snake, especially a big one. In fact, most big pythons stay on the ground for that very reason. Swimming is another story! Many pythons are excellent swimmers and spend a lot of time in the water. One of their ambush techniques for catching food is to lie submerged in a stream or slow-moving river with only their heads above the surface, waiting for a bird or small mammal to come to the water’s edge.
 
Some types of female pythons lay eggs in a shallow nest or even cover them with leaves and soil. But almost all python mothers stay coiled around their eggs to protect them while they develop. If the temperature gets too cold, the mothers of larger kinds of pythons warm up the eggs by "shivering." Moving their muscles like this creates a little extra heat for their offspring.
